    "## Problem 2: Classical Testing for Function Type\n",
    "### 2.1 problem Description\n",
    "Deutsch's algorithm is designed to demonstrate a potential advantage of quantum computing over classical computation. To understand this advantage, we must first understand the classical cost of solving the underlying problem. Write a Python function determine_constant_balanced that takes as input a function f, as defined in Problem 1. The function should analyze f and return the string \"constant\" or \"balanced\" depending on whether the function is constant or balanced. Write a brief note on the efficiency of your solution. What is the maximum number of times you need to call f to be 100% certain whether it is constant or balanced?\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 The Nature of the Problem\n",
    "Before implementing a solution, We must first understand the problem. <br>\n",
    "For this explanation, the function ``f`` is equal to ``random_constant_balanced`` <br>\n",
    "The function ``f`` operates on exactly 4 Boolean inputs, meaning its domain consists of 2^4 = 16 possible input combinations. Mathematically, this maps a 4-bit input to a 1-bit output: <br>\n",
    "{0,1}^4 -> {0,1}.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our function ``f`` is generated using a closure to hide its internal truth table from the user **(simulating a black box machine)**. <br>\n",
    "We are forced to evalulate it as such, the problem guarantees that ``f`` is going to be one of the two strict categories:\n",
    "1. **Constant:** The function evaluates to the exact same Boolean value (either **True** or **False** for all 16 inputs) <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Balanced:** The function evaluates to **True** for exactly half of the inputs **8** and **False** for the remaining half (8).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:** Our objective is to determine which category ``f`` falls into by querying it the absolute minimum number of times required to reach 100% certainty.\n",
    "At the end we will talk about the efficiency of the solution, which we will get by counting the number of queries the function `f` was called after determining its category as described in [The query model of computation, IBM Quantum Platform](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/learning/en/courses/fundamentals-of-quantum-algorithms/quantum-query-algorithms/query-model-of-computation)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3 Classical Computing Cost\n",
    "To accurately determine the classical computing cost, we must evaluate both the best case and worst case scenarios when querying our black box function\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the [IBM Quantum Platform (The Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm)](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/learning/en/courses/fundamentals-of-quantum-algorithms/quantum-query-algorithms/deutsch-jozsa-algorithm) course materials, we can break down the classical cost as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Best-case scenario:** If we query the function twice with different inputs and receive two different outputs (e.g., one True and one False), we immediately know the function is balanced. In this ideal situation, it only takes 2 queries to reach 100% certainty.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Worst-case scenario:** What if we query the function and keep getting the exact same result? Because a balanced 4-bit function contains exactly 8 identical outputs (either 8 Trues or 8 Falses), receiving 8 identical outputs in a row does not guarantee the function is constant. The very next query could yield a different result, proving it was balanced all along.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use the **Nielsen and Chuang's formula** to find the **maximum queries** as follows, which uses the logic we just talked about above:\n",
    "$$\\text{Maximum Queries} = 2^{n-1} + 1$$\n",
    "$$\\text{Maximum Queries Workings} = 2^{4-1} + 1 = 2^{3} + 1 = 8 + 1 = 9$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like when calculating time complexity of code, just because it has a chance of doing it in linear time, the algorithm is still treated as its worst case scenario time complexity e.g. N log N. <br>\n",
    "This means the cost of classical computing solving this problem will be the **Worst case**, which is always 9 queries\n",
